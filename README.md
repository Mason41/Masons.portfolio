About me-I love to play and coach football it has been my pation since i was little i want to become a head or assistant coach for highschool college or even the NFL one day! I'm a big camper and enjoy my time in the woodes im not the most person friendly, (more like im shy and wait for people to talk to me first) but everything camping is fantastic to me!I started this coding bootcamp because I love technology and i am passionate about it i want to get better and prove myself that i can be better at it just hard to memorize everything all at once.I currently work at a warehouse that is a sister company to NAPA auto parts, it is called Balkamp. I work as a stock handeler and i pull parts for a living. I have not been working recently because i tore my ACL and I have had many, many difficulties recovering but im planning on going back soon but i have no return table for it yet.
